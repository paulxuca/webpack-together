webpack together

Write webpack code collaboratively (jsx, ts, less, sass)  
compiles on server, delivers a bundle in real time (powered by webpack dev middleware)  
backed by firebase for real time collaboration  

still a WIP (some buggy things include: collaboration marking, run time package installation, users management and overall polish)
